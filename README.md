> 🧱 The HTML structure is already provided in `index.html` and **must not be modified**.

### Design Reference:

<img src="ziel.png" alt="Target view of the coastal benefits boxes" />

### Requirements:

- Three side-by-side card-style boxes
- Equal height, evenly spaced
- Smooth, rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Each feature includes:
  - an icon in the top-left corner
  - a large, bold heading
  - a short descriptive text below
  - a symbol button in the bottom-right corner (➡️)
- Font: Manrope
- Page background color: light gray (`#f5f5f7`)
- A hover effect for the cards (refer to the design reference)

💡 **Tip:** Use `flexbox`, `gap`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` for fine details.

Have fun coding! 🚀
